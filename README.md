**Overview**
This project involves analyzing the 2023 Stack Overflow survey results using Python and pandas. The dataset, available here, provides insights into respondents' preferences and trends.

**Tasks**
1. Extracting Desired Rows and Columns: Utilize pandas to extract specific rows and columns from the dataset.
2. Assigning Indexing: Assign indexing to a specific column in the dataset for easier referencing.
3. Creating Filters: Develop filters based on two parameters to narrow down data and print relevant tables.
4. Sorting the Table: Sort the table based on two parameters to organize the data effectively.
5. Statistical Functions: Utilize statistical functions (mean, standard deviation, median, min, max) to analyze the data.
6. Building Graphs: Construct two different types of graphs (e.g., bar and line charts) to visualize the data effectively.


Additionally, I have incorporated the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to visualize the bar chart and line graph.
